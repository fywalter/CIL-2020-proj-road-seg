Zhang-Suen Thinning
===================

This is the implementation of the Zhang-Suen thinning algorithm using OpenCV. The algorithm is explained in "A fast parallel algorithm for thinning digital patterns" by T.Y. Zhang and C.Y. Suen. See the tutorial in [opencv-code.com](http://opencv-code.com/quick-tips/implementation-of-thinning-algorithm-in-opencv/).

To use the thinning function, simply copy the `thinning()` and `thinningIteration()` function to your code. See the `main()` block for an example on how to use the function.

Both `thinning.cpp` and `thinning.py` are similar, except that the former written in C++ and the latter in Python.
